# Malloy Stateless Lib

The stateless lib is a static library to enable the use of Malloy without the runtime. The lib methods show how we can extract schema information, create a model, and generate SQL without the dependency on the runtime.

Check the [test/src/stateless-lib.spec.ts](#test/src/stateless-lib.spec.ts) for examples on how it works.
